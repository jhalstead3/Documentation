# Introduction

###### Use at your own risk.

Welcome to my documentation site. This site is intended to be a repository of solutions and information I've created or come across while working on various projects. Many \( most \) of the code, solutions, and workarounds here are not intended to be interpreted as best practices or even the recommended way to do something. I am not a programmer, nor do I consider myself an expert in any field. This repository is intended only as a place to record previous solutions with the intent of later reference when I have forgotten what I've done in the past. They worked for me, in a specific environment, and should be assumed not safe to be used without full understanding of the impact these changes may have on your environment.
